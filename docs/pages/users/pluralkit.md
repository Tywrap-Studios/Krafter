# PluralKit
[//]: # (TODO: Add KordEx badge)
The PluralKit software allows you to add accessibility to the bot for Plural people and Systems.

No idea what plurality is? No worries! There are enough sources online that can explain it neatly.
We personally recommend reading the following one: https://quiltmc.org/en/community/pluralkit/, as it also
nicely explains how the PluralKit bot works and how to use it.

Enabling this module is non-invasive, purely helpful, and will only fully work once you add the PluralKit
bot to your server yourself. It can seriously be a massive help to those struggling with expressing
themselves in online environments like Discord due to their plurality.

Thank you for keeping Discord safe and inclusive for everybody! <3

## Functions
When you enable PluralKit support for your bot, the bot will try its best to catch and
manage messages sent using the so-called "proxies", alongside interacting with the
PK API to aim to provide a flawless use of the bot as a PK member.

You may see it pop up in:
- Functions that require a member as input;
- Functions that require sent messages.
